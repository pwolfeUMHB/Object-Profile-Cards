# Web Application: User Profile Cards

## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a web application that displays user profile cards on a webpage. You will practice using three different methods to create objects in JavaScript: **object literals**, **constructor functions**, and the **Object.create()** method. Each method will be used to instantiate user objects that contain user details, which will then be displayed as profile cards using HTML and CSS.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply different object creation methods in JavaScript.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to dynamically display content.
- Use CSS to style user profile cards.

## Requirements

### HTML Structure
- Create a basic HTML page with a div container where the profile cards will be displayed. Include placeholders for the cards that will be generated by JavaScript.

### CSS Styling
- Style the user profile cards to make them visually appealing. Ensure that the cards are responsive and look good on all screen sizes. You can use the provided CSS as a starting point and modify or extend it as you see fit.

### JavaScript
You are required to create three separate user objects using the following methods:
1. **Object Literal**: Define an object directly with curly braces `{}`.
2. **Constructor Function**: Define a function that initializes a new object using the `new` keyword.
3. **Object.create() Method**: Create a new object that inherits properties from a prototype object.

Each user object should contain at least the following properties:
- `name`: The user's name.
- `job`: The user's job title.
- `picture`: A URL to a profile picture.

Dynamically generate profile cards based on these objects and append them to the container in your HTML. Each card should display the user's picture, name, and job title.

## Instructions

### a. HTML
Start with a simple structure. Include a div with an id such as `profilesContainer` where the profile cards will be inserted.

### b. CSS
Use the CSS from the example as a base. Feel free to customize the styles to add your personal touch or any additional styling.

### c. JavaScript
- Start by defining three different user objects using the specified methods. Provide unique details for each user.
- Write a function that takes a user object as an argument and generates a profile card. This function should create HTML elements for the user's name, job, and picture, then append these elements to the `profilesContainer` div.
- Ensure your script dynamically generates and displays a profile card for each user object upon page load.
